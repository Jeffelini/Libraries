Idea:
  Not to sure how to go about this tbh.
  Probably start with like, an HTML webpage? Then build everything around it?
  By like everything, I mean like Javascript, CSS, React Native (maybe),
  might also need a background database????? 
  But the ultimate goal is to get it to run on mobile.

Features:
  Log expenses, tag them (or have categories)
  List expenses
  Have a few graphs (last month / last year)
  Store them somewhere
